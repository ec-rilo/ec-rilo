## üèóÔ∏è  Current Project(s)

### ‚Ä¢ Iron-Motorcycle
<b>Utilized:</b> React | JS | HTML | CSS | Webpack | Jest

A Motorcycle company website where users can shop for many different types of motorcycles.
<br>
<p>
  As I started this project I wanted to emphasize working with react-router but that slowly evolved into designing and finding out how 
  to work with making projects look nice across a broad range of devices. This is a fully responsive website. This project does also heavily
  emphasize learning react router as well to be able to handle creating pages dynamically for each item and switching between them.

  Most if not all of the code will be housed in the development branch until it is ready for production.

### ‚Ä¢ Movie-Memory
<b>Utilized:</b> React | JS | HTML | CSS | Webpack | Jest

A Game that challenges your memory retention.
<br>
<p>
  With this project I wanted to refresh my knowledge with API's and broaden my scope of using React with hooks and functional 
  components. As well as organizational skills needed prior to even touching code. Throughout the project there are tests created 
  using jest as well as dynamic item creation with React. Being able to do a nice mix of JavaScript code and React was a focal point 
  of this project.

### ‚Ä¢ CV-Creator
<b>Utilized:</b> React | JS | HTML | CSS | Webpack | Jest

An easy to use CV-Application Creator.
<br>
<p>
  With this project I dove deep into the concepts of props and state with react. Finding creative ways to use them
  with as minimal use of the JavaScript equivalent as possible. Having used concepts like raising state and passing props
  to other components in order to update data while also dynamically creating and removing components throughout the project
  I now have a solid concept of how to use them! I also wanted to challenge myself in using react-testing-library which
  can be found sprinkled into the project.
